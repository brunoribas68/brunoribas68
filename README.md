### 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Ribas  
**Senior Software Engineer | Backend, AI & DevOps**

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and data-driven web applications. My background is primarily in backend development with PHP (Laravel) and Python, complemented by solid experience in AI systems, DevOps practices, and cloud-based architectures.

🎓 I hold a degree in Information Security and a postgraduate specialization in Applied Artificial Intelligence.  
🎓 I have been admitted to the **Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Software Engineering at Université de Sherbrooke (Canada)**, starting Fall 2026, which includes industry internships (co-op).

💼 Professionally, I’ve worked on:
- SaaS platforms and enterprise systems
- AI-powered solutions using LLMs and RAG pipelines
- CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and production stability
- Secure software development aligned with compliance and best practices

🧠 My technical interests focus on **real-world AI applications**, backend architecture, and automation — always with an emphasis on reliability, security, and maintainability.

🌍 I am currently preparing for relocation to Canada and actively engaging with the Canadian tech ecosystem.
